# Week7Project
This project will allow you to see how much money you can make after investing for certain amount of years. 
This will help people realize how they can make their money grow and work for them instead of leaving it in the bank where they would only get less than 0.02 interest earned.
The most important thing about compounding is that it offers interest on the previously earned interest along with the base capital. The whole idea of compounding is to build a broad base that keeps on adding to the previous earnings.
There is a class that will have different functions asking for your input
The first function will ask you how much money you want to start contributing to your investing plan
The second function will ask you how much you want to contribute on a monthly basis
Another method will ask you for how long you plan on investing in terms of years.
